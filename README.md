# Human-Computer-Interface-Project
EOG-based Simple Game Interface

This project implements a human-computer interface using Electrooculography (EOG) data. The goal is to design a simple game interface with the following features:

Data Acquisition: Teaching Assistants provide the EOG data required for the project.
EOG Preprocessing: Suitable preprocessing techniques are applied to the EOG data to enhance the signal quality.
Feature Extraction: Wavelet transform is employed to extract relevant features from the preprocessed EOG signals.
Classification: Two different classifiers are selected and optimized by testing various parameters to achieve the best results for each class.
Accuracy Comparison: The performance of the two classifiers is compared based on the achieved accuracy.
User Interface (UI): The UI presents a minimalistic game where a subject, represented by a small shape (e.g., circle), starts at a beginning point. The subject's movements are controlled by the detected EOG signals, aiming to reach an endpoint while avoiding obstacles (e.g., thin rectangles). The UI design is flexible and can be simplified while effectively conveying the core concept of the project.
This project serves as a demonstration of utilizing EOG data for human-computer interaction and showcases the implementation of classification algorithms and a simple game-based user interface.
